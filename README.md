# Notes Editor
A simple React application that allows you to quickly write up notes and edit notes using GitHub-flavoured Markdown. :pencil2:

The project includes some personalisation features including a light/dark mode, changing the editor font family and font size, and toggling the visibility of the different parts of the program.

:warning: ***IMPORTANT***: This project is still in development, and so you may encounter some bugs and crashes, such as trying to type in the editor right after deleting a note. The application has also not yet been designed to work with screens less than 1400px in length.
