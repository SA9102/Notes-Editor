# Notes Editor
:pencil2: A simple React application that allows you to quickly write up notes and edit notes using GitHub-flavoured Markdown.

The project includes some personalisation features including a light/dark mode, changing the editor font family and font size, and toggling the visibility of the different parts of the program.

:warning: ***IMPORTANT***: This project is still in development, and so you may encounter some bugs and crashes, such as trying to type in the editor right after deleting a note. The application has also not yet been designed to work properly with screens less than 1400px in length.

![Sample of the project. On the left side of the screen, there are tabs containing folders and notes. In the centre, there is the markdown editor, and on the right, the result of the parsed markdown is displayed. There are also some customisation settings at the top.](https://github.com/SA9102/Notes-Editor/blob/main/assets/Preview.png)
